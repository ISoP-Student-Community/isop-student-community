The ISoP student community seeks to foster the interest in pharmacometrics by promoting communication among trainees from various disciplines aiming for efficient drug development and rational drug treatment in patients. The main focus of this community is to create a dynamic platform for educational and scientific events that allows trainees to exchange and broaden their knowledge in this field. Furthermore, peers from all over the world now have the opportunity to interact and support each otherâ€™s professional development. Our mission is to give trainees the opportunity to voice and lead the future of pharmacometrics with ISoP. The ISoP student community is composed of trainee members from academic institutes across the globe.
